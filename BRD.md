## 1. Executive Summary

This document defines the business requirements for a hyperlocal breakfast delivery platform. The platform connects consumers with local food suppliers (bakeries, dairy farmers, specialty vendors) via a mobile app, enabling pre-scheduled, fresh breakfast delivery between 06:00 and 09:00.

The primary business driver is the **untapped morning revenue opportunity** for local food suppliers and the **consumer convenience gap** not addressed by existing general-purpose delivery platforms.
